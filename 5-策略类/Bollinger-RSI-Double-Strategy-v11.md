> Strategy Description

This strategy uses the RSI indicator together with the Bollinger Bands to sell when the price is above the upper Bollinger Band (and to buy when this value is below the lower band). This simple strategy only triggers when both the RSI and the Bollinger Band indicators are at the same time in a overbought or oversold condition.

**UPDATE**
In this updated version 1.1 the strategy was both simplified for the user (less inputs) and made more successful in backtesting by now using a 200 period for the SMA which is the basis for the Bollinger Band . I also reduced the number of color alerts to show fewer, but more relevant trading opportunities.

And just like the first version this strategy does not use close prices from higher-time frame and should not repaint after the current candle has closed. It might repaint like every Tradingview indicator while the current candle hasn't closed.

All trading involves high risk; past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact , if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.


P.S. For advanced users if you want access to more functions of this strategy script, then please use version 1.0:
